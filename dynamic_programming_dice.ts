// Consider tiles sequentially numbered from 0 to 100. 
// You start at tile 0 and move forward based on the outcome of a six sided die. 
// Whenever you land on a tile you gain points based on the number of the tile. 
// If the tile is evenly divisble by 3, you get 2 points. 
// If the tile is evenly divisible by 5, you get 2 points. 
// However, if the tile is both evenly divisible by 3 and 5, then you get 4 points. 
// For all other tiles, you only get 1 point. 
// For example, you get 2 points for landing on tile 3 and 4 points for landing on tile 15. 
// You keep rolling the die and accumulating points until you either land on the last tile, numbered 100, or you move beyond the last tile. 
// For example, if you are currently at tile 95 and roll a 6, you move past 100 and the game ends. 
// Note, you only collect points from tile 100 if you land on it. 
// Please provide 6 digits of precision.
// What is the expected value and standard deviation of the final score?
